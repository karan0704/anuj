# CI Formats Review

Read `.agents/agents/ci-formats-reviewer.md` before reviewing.

Also read `.agents/rules/testing.md` when snapshots or integration tests are involved.

Focus on:
- format correctness
- compatibility with CI consumers
- empty-input handling
- stable snapshots and ordering

End with `APPROVE`, `CONCERN`, or `BLOCK`.
